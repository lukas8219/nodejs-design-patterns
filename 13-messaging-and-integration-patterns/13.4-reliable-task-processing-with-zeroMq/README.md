Implement a mechanism to make our hashsum cracker example with ZeroMQ more reliable. As we already mentioned, with the implementation we saw in this chapter, if a worker crashes, all the tasks it was processing are lost. Implement a peer-to-peer queuing system and an acknowledgment mechanism to make sure that the message is always processed at least once (excluding errors due to hypothetical unprocessable tasks).
